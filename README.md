# **Courses and Practice**

`courses_and_practice` is where I organise and share my progress in programming, exploring different approaches and continually honing my technical skills. It reflects my interest in problem-solving and my commitment to continuous improvement.

This repository gathers my programming studies, including solutions, experiments, and reflections on challenges from various platforms and initiatives:

- [CS50](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science): An     introductory course in Computer Science from Harvard University, covering everything from fundamental algorithms to more advanced concepts.
- [Beecrowd](https://judge.beecrowd.com/en/login?): A Brazilian platform with competitive programming problems, ideal for developing logical reasoning and problem-solving skills.
- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about): A collection of problems blending mathematics and programming, designed to foster analytical and creative thinking.

Feel free to explore the content and share any feedback or suggestions!
